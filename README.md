## Dev Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```console
cd agent-starter-node
pnpm install
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) then set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required keys:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
pnpm run download-files
```

To run the agent during development, use the `dev` command:

```console
pnpm run dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
pnpm run start
```
